## Overview

This project explores data-driven approaches for predicting sleep patterns and quality using machine learning. It aims to uncover insights about the factors that influence sleep, helping researchers, practitioners, and individuals better understand sleep health.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of sleep-related features
- Implementation and comparison of multiple machine learning models for sleep prediction
- Model evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Feature importance analysis for understanding influential factors

## Dataset

The project utilizes datasets on sleep patterns and related factors, including:
- Demographic information (age, gender, etc.)
- Lifestyle habits (exercise, caffeine intake, screen time, etc.)
- Sleep duration and quality metrics

**Source:**  
(Please specify your data sources, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or any other relevant source.)

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sfatty47/Sleep-Prediction.git
   cd Sleep-Prediction
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run analysis scripts or notebooks:**
   - Jupyter notebooks are located in the `notebooks/` directory for step-by-step exploration.
   - Main scripts for training and evaluation are in the `src/` directory.
